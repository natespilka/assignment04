      <txt><![CDATA[WT06 provides ATUS respondent weights based on the weighting methodology introduced in 2006. WT06 is available for all years and is the preferred weighting variable to use for most analyses.  It is the only weighting variable that is suitable for use in analyses that combine time use data from 2006 and later with data for earlier years.  The methodology used to construct WT06 ensures that the sums of the respondent weights add up to the appropriate number of weekday person-days and weekend person-days over the quarter, both for the population as a whole and for selected subpopulations. 

All ATUS weights are probability weights. Users should take care to specify them properly in their statistical packages.

Because the ATUS sample is not a simple random sample, standard errors calculated using the default options in most statistical packages will not be correct.  Calculation of correct standard errors requires the use of replicate weights.  RWT06 may be used in conjunction with WT06 for this purpose; for further details, see the description of RWT06.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[EDUCYRS reports the respondent's years of education.

EDUC reports the highest level the respondent has completed.  As degrees can take varying amounts of time to complete, EDUCYRS was created from a series of questions that assess the amount of time spent in various educational programs. 

The following categories include people with the following types of education:

Twelfth grade: Respondents who report a twelfth grade education are assigned a value of 112.  Respondents who receive a high school diploma are also included in this category, as are respondents who complete less than one year of college, including respondents who receive an associate's degree after less than one year of college.

College--four years: Respondents who report having completed four years of college credit are assigned a value of 216, as are respondents (in the CPS prior to 2015) who have a bachelor's degree but no post-graduate education.

College degree: Respondents who completed their rotation in the CPS in 2015 or later and who report having completed a bachelor's degree but no post-graduate education.

Master's degree: Respondents who completed their rotation in the CPS in 2015 or later and who report having completed a master's degree.

Master's degree--one year program: Respondents who report receiving a master's degree in a one-year program, or who report earning 1-6 graduate or professional course credits are assigned a value of 317.

Master's degree--two year program: Respondents who report receiving a master's degree in a two-year program, or who report earning more than six graduate or professional course credits are assigned a value of 318.

Master's degree--three year program: Respondents who report receiving a master's degree in a three-year program are assigned a value of 319.

      <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. 

Employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week. Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as "at work." Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading "employed - absent." 

Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force. Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. 

Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, "not in labor force." Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).

EMPSTAT was collected at the time of the ATUS interview.  Employment status was also collected at the time of the final CPS interview, 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.  See EMPSTAT_CPS8.  EMPSTAT_CPS8 distinguishes between not being in the labor force due to retirement, disability, or other reasons, but EMPSTAT does not.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[SCC_ALL reports the total amount of time during the diary day that the respondent spent in secondary childcare for all children under the age of 13.  This variable is calculated by summing the amount of time during each activity that the respondent reported having a child in care. 

The methodology for capturing secondary childcare changed between 2003 and 2004.  In 2003, for household children and own, non-household children, secondary childcare time is not recorded if the respondent's main activity is sleeping (0101xx) or directly related to the care of household children (0301xx, 0302xx, 0303xx, 180301, 180302, 180303, or 180304).  Secondary childcare is not recorded if all household children are asleep, but may be recorded for part of an activity if a child wakes up or goes to bed during the activity.  For non-own, non-household children, secondary childcare time is not recorded if the respondent's main activity is sleeping (0101xx) or directly related to the care of non-household children (0401xx, 0402xx, 0403xx, 180401, 180402, 180403, 180404).  Waking and sleep times are not asked of non-household children.

Beginning in 2004, for household children, secondary childcare is not recorded if the respondent's main activity is sleeping (0101xx) or directly related to the care of household children (0301xx, 0302xx, 0303xx, 180301, 180302, 180303, or 180304).  Secondary childcare is not recorded if all household children are asleep, but may be recorded for part of an activity if a child wakes up or goes to bed during the activity.  Secondary childcare of non-household children is not recorded if the respondent's main activity is sleeping (0101xx), directly related to the care of household children (0301xx, 0302xx, 0303xx, 180301, 180302, 180303, or 180304), or directly related to the care of non-household children (0401xx, 0402xx, 0403xx, 180401, 180402, 180403, 180404).  Waking and sleep times are not asked of non-household children.

Secondary childcare time total variables are available for a variety of sub-categories of children as well: household or own non-household children (see SCC_HHNHHOWN), own household children (see SCC_OWNHH, not available for 2003), own, non-household children (see SCC_OWNNHH, not available for 2003), non-own household children (see SCC_NOWNHH, not available for 2003), own children (see SCC_OWN, not available for 2003), household children (see SCC_HH, not available for 2003), and non-own, non-household children (see SCC_NOWNNHH). 

Users can also apply a secondary child care filter in the extract builder when creating time use variables. Distinctions are available for the following groups:

All children

Household or own non-household children

Own household children (not available for 2003)

Own, non-household children (not available for 2003)

Non-own household children (not available for 2003)

Non-own, non-household children
User note: In a handful of cases, values in this variable may be different than those obtained by making a time use variable through the extract builder that specifies all activities and secondary childcare. The source of the difference is that the last activity respondents report may extend beyond 4:00 a.m. (see DURATION_EXT) and may also be one in which the respondents report secondary childcare. If the last activity extends beyond 4:00 a.m. and the respondent reports secondary childcare, SCC_ALL is created using the value in SCC_ALL_LN; alternatively, the extract builder restricts the total time in the day to 24 hours and does not allow the value of SCC_ALL_LN to extend beyond 4:00 a.m.]]></txt>
